# Green Stock Module Challenge
This assignment is an application of coding in Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA) for Excel to analyze stocks for a client by creating a simple program. Initial coding of this assignment was for a simple macro that analyzed returns for 12 stocks to determine the returns in the year 2018. However, due to the need to simplify the code for future usage, refactoring the code was necessary to run on future stock analysis.
