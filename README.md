# Challenge
This assignment is an application of coding in VBA for Excel to analyze stocks for a client by creating a simple program in VBA. It goes through covering loops and arrays which were the most difficult in the assignment when I switched over to trying to re-design the code for the challenge assignment. I will definitely be practicing this module more as the re-designing process was very difficult.
