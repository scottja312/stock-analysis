# Green Stock Module Challenge Overview
This assignment is an application of coding in Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA) for Excel to analyze stocks for a client (Steve) by creating a simple macro that would determine the best stocks for the client's parents investment.

### Purpose
Initial coding of this assignment was for a simple macro that analyzed returns for 12 stocks to determine the returns in the year 2018. However, due to the need to simplify the code for future usage, refactoring the code was necessary to run on future stock analysis.  

### Goals
The goals of this challenge are to:
  1. Analyze code and explain how it accomplishes a task.
  
  2. Evaluate logic flow of for loops and conditionals.
  
  3.  Extend your pattern recognition skills to refactor existing code.

### Method of Refractoring Code 
Software used: Microsoft Excel VBA Script
The first stock analysis was performed on DAQO stock that showed a negative return of -63%, inidicating that for purposes of this analysis, the macro code written performs accurately although the returns on the stock were not ideal. Following the initial test macro code written for DAQO, an "All Stocks Analysis" tab was created and coding of a macro for analyzing the following 12 stocks listed in the picture below. 


### Results




### Discussion on Refactoring Code
